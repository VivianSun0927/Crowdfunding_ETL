# Project 2: Crowdfunding_ETL

For the ETL mini project, we were to work individually or with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming the data, we were to create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we were to upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
